Particle initial solution:
1-10: random, own fleet (multiple jobs per truck possible)
11-20: random, including charters (multiple jobs per truck possible)
21-30: random, including charters (1 job max own fleet, rest charters) 
31: all job assigned to closest own truck
32: first closest job assigned to own truck, rest to charters
33: all charters
